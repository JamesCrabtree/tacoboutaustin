# Self-Critique

--- 

## What did we do well? - Frontend

- The splash page is beautiful |
- The logo, loading animation, and rating icons are custom-made, original, and relevant to the site |
- The site is user-friendly, easy to navigate, and looks good overall |
- We implemented our own pagination and highlighting logic without dependencies |
- Filtering and sorting work well |
- Our site also looks pretty good on mobile devices |

---

## What did we do well? -  Backend

- Our data models are structured in a logical and clean way |
- Our API is easy-to-use and has many options for developers |
- We don't use Flask RESTless, and our API is custom-made |
- We also did categories, searching, and filtering on the backend |

---

## What did we learn?

- We learned how to design an attractive site using React and Bootstrap  |
- We learned how to make API calls to our own API and other APIs and how to organize and display this data efficiently  |
- We learned how to create tables in our database and query data using SQLAlchemy  |
- We learned how to work as a team and depend on one another <3  |

---

## What can we do better?
- Our API could have nearby places as a separate endpoint  |
- We could have a search bar in the navigation bar instead of the word "Search"  |
- We could have a way for users to submit ratings and reviews for places  |
- We could make improvements on mobile  |

---

## What puzzles us?
- We would also like to save filters and user preferences when users navigate throughout the site -- we can use cookies for this, but we didn't put time into implementing these details  |

- We would like to get better data but found it difficult because the best APIs were closed off to us  |

## What did they do well?

- When the user goes back from another page their filters are not lost  |
- They have loading icons for everything, which is nice  |
- Their search returns lots of results and works very well  |

---

## What did we learn from their api / website?

- Their API allows you to use a subject ID under the course endpoint to see all the courses related to a subject  |
- Their filters use a dropdown menu, which inspired us to do a similar design  |
- We like how they have a summary of their data on their splash page  |

---

## What can they do better?

- Detail pages could have more information and interactivity  |

- Their images are low resolution and are frequently duplicated  |


---

## What puzzles us about their api / website?

- On their courses page, you can filter by subject but the subject is not shown on the course cards  |
