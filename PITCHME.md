# Tacoboutaustin

### Where to eat, where to stay, and what to do in Austin, Texas.

---

## Juanito Taveras
- I'm finishing college next week. I enjoy making multi-media content.
- I worked mainly on front-end content. I made drawings and animations for the site, and wrote a lot of JSX code to put together our React components, such as Searching, Highlighting, and Loading components.

---


## James Crabtree

- I'm a junior CS student focusing on AI and game development
- I worked on the back-end side of the website and was mainly responsible for server management, data scraping, and api searching, sorting, and filtering

--- 

## Caroline Shi
- I'm a third year student and a unicorn (a native Austinite!)
- I worked on the front-end, including writing React components and unit tests. Specifically, I worked on things such as the sorting, filtering, splash page, and grid cards. 

---
## An Vo
 - I moved to the U.S about five years ago.
 - I worked mostly on the back-end.
 - I created tables, relationships, API endpoints and wrote unit tests.

## Eduardo Campos
 - Iâ€™m a third year CS student, currently working at Synopsys.

# Self-Critique

## What did we do well? - Frontend

- The Splash Page is beautiful. |
- The logo, loading animation, and rating icons are custom-made, original, and relevant to the site. |
- The site is very user-friendly, easy to navigate, and looks good overall. |
- We implemented our own pagination and highlighting components without dependencies.
- Filtering and sorting work very well also.
- Our site also looks pretty good on mobile devices.

---

## What did we do well? -  Backend

- Our data models are structured in a very logical and clean way.
- Our API is easy-to-use and has many options for developers.
- We don't use Flask RESTless, and our API is custom-made.
- We also did categories, searching, and filtering on the backend.

---

## What did we learn?

- We learned how to design an attractive site using React and Bootstrap.
- We learend how to make API calls to our own API and other APIs, and how to organize and display this data efficiently.
- We learned how to create tables in our database and query data using SQLAlchemy.
- We learned how to work as a team and depend on one another <3.

---

## What can we do better?
- Our API could have closeby places as a separate endpoint.
- We would have a search bar in the navigation bar instead of the word "Search".
- We could have a way for users to submit ratings and reviews for places.
- We could make improvements on mobile.

---

## What puzzles us?
- We would also like to save filters and user preferences when users navigate throughout the site - we can use cookies for this, but we didn't put time into implementing these details.
- We would like to get better data, but found it difficult because the best APIs were closed off to us.

# Other-critique - Learn2Earn

---

## What did they do well?

- When the user goes back from another page their filters are not lost.
- They have loading icons for everything, which is nice.
- Their search returns lots of results and works very well.

---

## What did we learn from their api / website?

- Their API allows you to use a subject ID under the course endpoint to see all the courses related to a subject.
- Their filters use a dropdown menu, which inspired us to do a similar design.
- We like how they have a summary of their data on their Splash Page.

---

## What can they do better?

- Detail pages could have more information and interactivity.

- Their images are low resolution and are frequently duplicated.


---

## What puzzles us about their api / website?

- On their courses page, you can filter by subject but the subject is not shown on the Course cards.
